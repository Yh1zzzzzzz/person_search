We introduce T5Gemma 2, the next generation of the T5Gemma family of lightweight open encoder-
decoder models, featuring strong multilingual, multimodal and long-context capabilities. T5Gemma 2
follows the adaptation recipe (via UL2) in T5Gemma – adapting a pretrained decoder-only model into
an encoder-decoder model, and extends it from text-only regime to multimodal based on the Gemma 3
models. We further propose two methods to improve the efficiency: tied word embedding that shares
all embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention that unifies decoder self- and cross-
attention into a single joint module. Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy
over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture
on long context modeling. Similar to T5Gemma, T5Gemma 2 yields comparable or better pretraining
performance and significantly improved post-training performance than its Gemma 3 counterpart. We
release the pretrained models (270M-270M, 1B-1B and 4B-4B) to the community for future research.

T5Gemma 2 at 270M, 1B and 4B over five capabilities. 270M for T5Gemma 2 means a 270M encoder
with a 270M decoder (the same applies to 1B and 4B). X: multilingual. Note the post-training result
for T5Gemma 2 is for illustration, where we only performed slight supervised finetuning without RL.

Figure 2 | Overview of T5Gemma 2. Encoder/decoder parameters are initialized from the pretrained
decoder-only model, and then pretrained with UL2. We tie all word embeddings (in blue) and merge
decoder self- and cross-attention sub-layers. Image is preprocessed by SigLIP into 256 embedding
tokens and fed to the encoder for vision understanding (see [img] for illustration).

for many real-world applications, regardless of model architectures (Achiam et al., 2023; Anthropic,
2024; Comanici et al., 2025). In recent years, the encoder-decoder architecture has regained increasing
interests in LLMs for its competitive scaling properties and flexible architectures (Zhang et al., 2022,
2025a) and promising pre-/post-training performance (Ao et al., 2022; Elfeki et al., 2025; Li et al.,
2023; Raffel et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2021, 2022). Particularly,
T5Gemma establishes modern, general-purpose encoder-decoder LLMs with non-trivial performance
across benchmarks (Zhang et al., 2025b). Still, the vast majority of these models (if not all) are blind,
operating exclusively on text-based data with limited context length – a substantial gap compared to
the advanced decoder-only LLMs (Team et al., 2025a,b; Xu et al., 2025).

In this paper, we fill this gap and present T5Gemma 2, a new family of lightweight open encoder-
decoder LLMs with strong multilingual, multimodal and long-context capabilities. T5Gemma 2 follows
the adaptation recipe from T5Gemma (Zhang et al., 2025b): initializing model parameters from a
pretrained decoder-only checkpoint and then adapting them with the UL2 objective as in Figure 2.
We further extend the recipe from the text-only realm to multimodal and long-context based on the
powerful Gemma 3 models (Team et al., 2025a). For vision modeling, T5Gemma 2 reuses the same
vision encoder from Gemma 3 and keeps it frozen; vision tokens are always fed to the encoder and
all encoder tokens always have full visibility to each other in the self attention. For long-context
modeling, we adopt the positional interpolation methods (Chen et al., 2023; Team et al., 2025a). We
also propose two strategies to save model parameters and improve the efficiency: 1) tying all word
embeddings across encoder and decoder; and 2) merging the decoder self- and cross-attention into a
single unified merged attention.

T5Gemma 2 features three model sizes: 270M-270M, 1B-1B, and 4B-4B. We pretrain each model
on ∼2T tokens with an input/output sequence length up to 16K, and perform evaluation following
Gemma 3. As in Figure 1, the resulting T5Gemma 2 model shows competitive performance across
different capabilities, matching and even surpassing its Gemma 3 counterpart in both pre- and post-
training. Particularly, T5Gemma 2 270M-270M and 1B-1B yield encouraging multimodal performance
even though their Gemma 3 base models are text-only, resonating with PaliGemma (Steiner et al.,
2024). Besides, T5Gemma 2 delivers consistently improved long-context performance (up to 128K)
despite of being pretrained on shorter sequences (only 16K), suggesting the special advantage of
the encoder-decoder architecture on handling long context (Zhang et al., 2025a). We present the
detailed results and also provide ablations justifying our architectural designs.

2. T5Gemma 2

T5Gemma 2 is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder LLM (Vaswani et al., 2017). Its basic building
block follows Gemma 3: grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023) with QK-norm (Dehghani
et al., 2023), pre- and post-norm with RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019), RoPE for positional
encoding (Su et al., 2024), and interleaved local and global attention layers with a ratio of 5:1. To
improve long-context modeling, we set the RoPE base frequency to 10k and 1M for local and global
attention layers, respectively (Team et al., 2025a). The 400M SigLIP encoder is adopted as the vision
encoder (Zhai et al., 2023), which transforms an image to 256 embedding tokens and is frozen during
the training.

Tied Embedding T5Gemma uses separate word embeddings for the encoder and the decoder,
which add a significant amount of model parameters particularly for small models. In T5Gemma
2, we instead tie all word embeddings (encoder input embedding, decoder input embedding and
decoder output/softmax embedding) following T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). Table 1 shows that tying
embeddings leads to nearly no quality change but reduces the parameters by 10.5%, suggesting the
high redundancy of embedding parameters.

Merged Attention In the encoder-decoder architecture, cross-attention is often represented as a
separated sub-layer in the decoder block, inserted in between the self-attention and feed-forward
sub-layers. However, the functionality of the self- and cross-attention shares high similarity: gathering
relevant information from the past. Inspired by previous studies (Chowdhery et al., 2023; Fu et al.,
2023; Zhang et al., 2019), we merge these two types of attentions into a single module with shared
attention parameters.

Concretely, given the encoder output H ∈ ℝ𝑛×𝑑 and the decoder self-attention input X ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑑,

the merged attention operates as below:

Q ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑑ℎ = XW𝑞
K ∈ ℝ(𝑚+𝑛) ×𝑑ℎ = [X; H] W𝑘
V ∈ ℝ(𝑚+𝑛) ×𝑑ℎ = [X; H] W𝑣

A ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑑ℎ = SoftMax

where 𝑛/𝑚 represents the encoder/decoder input length and 𝑑/𝑑ℎ is model/head dimension. For
simplicity, we only describe the single head case. W𝑞, W𝑘, W𝑣 ∈ ℝ𝑑×𝑑ℎ and W𝑜 ∈ ℝ𝑑ℎ ×𝑑 are regular

attention weight parameters. We concatenate the encoder output and decoder input [X; H] such that
both types of attention can be performed together. Note attention logits are also normalized jointly,
similar to the decoder-only models. The masking M ∈ ℝ𝑚× (𝑚+𝑛) handles the visibility to tokens from
both encoder and decoder.

Merged attention narrows the architectural differences between the T5Gemma 2 decoder and the
Gemma 3 decoder (see Figure 2), which eases the parameter initialization. Similarly, the encoder
and decoder in T5Gemma 2 have roughly the same model parameters (see Table 2). Ablations in
Table 1 show that merged attention saves 6.5% parameters and results in slight quality reduction1,
∼0.3 points on average, which we consider as an acceptable trade-off.

Rejected Ablation: Cross-Attention on Global Layers Only By default, T5Gemma applies cross-
attention to all decoder layers following the standard encoder-decoder architecture (Vaswani et al.,
2017). However, this adds non-ignorable computational cost particularly considering the autoregres-
sive inference bottleneck and its global-attention structure. We thus explored a variant where we
only apply it to decoder layers with global self-attention sub-layers, i.e. adding one cross-attention
sub-layer every six decoder layers. Unfortunately, the experiments show a substantial quality drop by
∼1.3 points on average (see Table 1). We consider this direction as reasonable but will need more
efforts to retain the performance.

3. Setup

3.1. Pretraining

Data Our pretraining data follows Gemma 3, which is a mixture of multilingual web documents,
code, mathematical corpus and images (Team et al., 2025a). We preprocess the data with UL2 (Tay
et al., 2022) into ≤16K input sequences paired with ≤16K target outputs. Specifically, for text data,
we apply the following five denoising tasks: (𝜇 = 3, 𝑟 = 0.15, 𝑛), (𝜇 = 12, 𝑟 = 0.5, 𝑛), (𝜇 = 32, 𝑟 =
0.15, 𝑛), (𝜇 = 32, 𝑟 = 0.5, 𝑛) and (𝜇 = 3
𝐿, 𝑟 = 0.75, 1) with a mixing ratio of 1:1:1:1:4, where 𝜇 is the
4
mean span length, 𝑟 is the corruption rate, 𝑛 is the number of corrupted spans, and 𝐿 is the input
sequence length. We refer the readers to Tay et al. (2022) for more details. For vision data, we only
use prefix language modeling: all input tokens until the end of the final image are used as prefix, and
the remaining text tokens are used as targets. Note, distillation is not used. The final pretraining
data includes ∼2T tokens.

Optimization We initialize T5Gemma 2 parameters from the corresponding Gemma 3 pretraining
checkpoint. All models are trained with a batch size of 4.2M tokens, and with the standard cross-
entropy loss. Learning rate follows cosine decay with a warmup step of 100. To stabilize the training,

1Note the parameter reduction (6.5%) is based on the total parameters, i.e, both model and embedding parameters.

we apply global gradient clipping at 1.0 and weight decay. We perform a simple grid search to decide
the optimal learning rate for each model. The final pretraining checkpoint is created by averaging
over the last 5 checkpoints (saved with an interval of 10K steps) Wortsman et al. (2022).

3.2. Post-training

We also perform slight instruction tuning to showcase the strengths of encoder-decoder LLMs on
downstream finetuning. Different from Gemma 3 post-training which includes distillation from
stronger teacher and RL finetuning (Team et al., 2025a), we only apply distillation learning and
train models with much less compute. Note the post-training performance in this paper should be
considered as the lowerbound.

Table 5 | Detailed post-training results for Gemma 3, T5Gemma, and T5Gemma 2. T5Gemma 2
outperforms Gemma 3 on most capabilities despite its lightweight post-training.

4. Results

PrefixLM+KD, UL2, vs. UL2+KD: Do distillation and training objective matter? T5Gemma
ablates the effect of different pretraining data (PrefixLM+KD vs. UL2), showing mixed results. In
T5Gemma 2, we further examine these options and also compare to UL2+KD, where we use teacher
logits for real target tokens and one-hot logits for special masking tokens.

Table 3 shows that PrefixLM+KD generally performs the worst while UL2(+KD) is consistently
better for models ≤ 1B-1B. UL2+KD performs slightly better at 1B-1B than UL2 by ∼0.4 points on
average. With T5Gemma results, we argue that the effect of distillation highly depends on the teacher
and student modeling capacity (Zhou et al., 2019). We decided to drop the distillation due to its
expensive data loading overhead and simply use UL2 for T5Gemma 2.

Text-only LLMs can be adapted into strong multimodal and long-context encoder-decoder
models. While Gemma 3 270M and 1B are text-only and context limited, Table 4 shows that
our adaptation recipe successfully adapts them into multimodal and long-context with non-trivial

7

T5Gemma 2: Seeing, Reading, and Understanding Longer

performance, resonating with previous findings (Chen et al., 2023; Steiner et al., 2024). For example,
T5Gemma 2 1B-1B yields an average multimodal and long-context result of 49.8 and 43.8, lagging
behind Gemma 3 4B by only 8.7 and 6.9 points, respectively, despite being much smaller. We
ascribe this to the special architecture of encoder-decoder models, where the encoder parameters are
exclusively used for input/vision understanding with bidirectional attention, and the cross-attention
allows for attending to high-level representations of the input.

T5Gemma 2 achieves competitive pretraining performance and improved post-training per-
formance than Gemma 3. Overall, T5Gemma 2 270M-270M and 1B-1B substantially outperform
Gemma 3 270M and 1B after pretraining across benchmarks, respectively. It performs on par with or
slightly better than Gemma 3 at 4B-4B scale, as shown in Table 4. After post-training, T5Gemma 2
generally surpasses Gemma 3 despite its lightweight finetuning, as shown in Table 5, echoing with pre-
vious findings (Wang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2025a,b). Note the post-training result for T5Gemma
2 is for illustration only, and we believe it could be significantly enhanced with comprehensive RL
learning.

We note that T5Gemma 2 shows consistently better long-context and multi-modal performance
than Gemma 3 and T5Gemma. This demonstrates 1) the adaptation recipe from T5Gemma generalizes
across modalities, and 2) the unique adaptability of encoder-decoder models. We hope these insights
can inspire further exploration on the encoder-decoder architecture for general-purpose language
modeling.

5. Conclusion

We have presented T5Gemma 2, the new collection of vision-language encoder-decoder foundation
model. T5Gemma 2 was built by adapting the pretrained decoder-only Gemma 3 models into encoder-
decoder on ∼2T UL2 tokens. We ablated several architecture designs and integrated two proposal to
save model parameters: tied embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention unifying
decoder self- and cross-attention sub-layers. The resulting decoder architecture resembles the encoder
architecture, facilitating the adaptation from decoder-only models.

T5Gemma 2 accepts text and/or image as inputs to the encoder, and generates response text
from the decoder. We evaluated the models across a range of benchmarks, covering five capabilities:
reasoning and factuality, stem and coding, multilingual, multimodal and long-context. In general,
T5Gemma 2 shows competitive pretraining performance than Gemma 3 and improved post-training
performance across capabilities.

Especially, T5Gemma 2 shows strong multimodal and long-context performance, thanks to its
encoder-decoder architecture. Unlike decoder-only LLMs, T5Gemma 2 has a dedicated set of encoder
parameters for input/vision or prompt understanding. Its cross-attention over the encoder outputs
also endows it with better ability on retrieving relevant information from the inputs.

Beyond standalone usage, T5Gemma 2 serves as a robust foundation for training high-quality
downstream embedding models. For example, EmbeddingGemma (Vera et al., 2025) leverages
T5Gemma 2 checkpoints to achieve state-of-the-art performance on text retrieval benchmarks.

We released all three pretrained checkpoints (270M-270M, 1B-1B and 4B-4B) to facilitate the
evaluation, adaptation and research by the community. Note, to the best of our knowledge, T5Gemma
2 presents itself as the first capable long-context encoder-decoder LLMs (up to 128K) in the community.
By offering novel insights into encoder-decoder LLMs, we hope this work to be a catalyst for future
innovation, ultimately benefiting the development of more sophisticated and powerful LLMs.
